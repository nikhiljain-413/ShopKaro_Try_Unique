This is a website which was created with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django was used to handle the backend.
Django is a python framework which is easy to use and handle databases.
We don't have to handle databases manually instead we are given an admin panel so that we can see what is the schema of the table and what all entities are there in tha table. We can manully add and delete the products. Also we are provided with admin.py file which handles the admin task.
Also our application is divided into two parts one is project and the other is apps. We an have multiple apps in in one project.
It also provides the facilities of templates and static files where we can keep all our files like HTML,CSS,JavaScript in one folder and images in other folders called static directories.
